== Introduction

MarbleRun presents a novel keyboard layout tailored for standard keyboards, aiming to enhance typing efficiency across English text and programming contexts.
The primary objective of MarbleRun is to reduce the overall typing effort required.
Its layout prioritizes hand alternation and facilitates smooth finger rolls during typing sequences.
Optimized using a sophisticated typing work model based on hand anatomy, this results in a comfortable and ergonomic typing experience.

=== The Layout

MarbleRun differs substantially from the standard QWERTY keyboard layout:

* Alphabet letters are placed in a completely different order.
* Comparison and logic symbols are consolidated in the number row.
* Underscores and asterisks are relocated to the alphabet rows.
* Parentheses, brackets and punctuation change both position and shift partners.

Although some adjustments were made manually, the primary arrangement within the alphabet rows was determined through a heuristic search across all possible layouts.
This means the placement decisions were guided by the cost function that was minimized in the search, which is the estimated typing work according to our model.
While we cannot follow the rationale behind each placement choice, we can examine the typing work model to get some basic understanding.

=== Home Row

A little ergonomics experiment first:

Let your arms hang down at the side of your body, all relaxed including hands and fingers.
Close your eyes.
Now carefully place your fingertips on a flat surface, as if you would be typing there.
Make sure your hands and fingers are still fully relaxed.
Open your eyes and observe where your fingertips landed.
This is your actual "home row" in relaxed position.

Traditionally, the home row has been defined as four keys for each hand in the middle row.
In my observations, the middle and ring finger settle about half a key above the middle row, when relaxed.
Therefore the "home row" should also consider keys from the upper row:

This is just the starting point for the ergonomics considered in MarbleRun, and the typing work model derived from that.

=== Installation

Windows::
Please download the Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator to open the link:Windows/MarbleRun/MarbleRun.klc[MarbleRun.klc] file from this repo.
It will create keyboard layouts with installers, make sure to choose the right architecture (typically amd64).
For convenience, there are also ready-made installers in a subfolder of this repo, but it is bad practice security-wise.

Xorg and Wayland::
Patching the keyboard layouts system-wide is the most convenient and reliable option currently, sorry about this.
Patches can be found in the `xkb` directory of this repo, MarbleRun will then be available as a US keyboard layout variant.
